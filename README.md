Are you a music addict? Obviously you are, who isn’t. Remember being hooked to music visualisers that simulates not only your sense of hearing but also your sense of sight.<br><br>
Music visualizers have been a familiar sight on computers for a while. They are essentially animated imagery synchronized with whatever musical selection being played, and changes with every song.<br><br>
A great variety of instruments come together to create the 3 minute song you vibe to. But, have you ever wished to absorb every independent piece of the song, individually, all at the same time?<br><br>
There exists no music visualiser which animates on the basis of the instruments comprising a song, hence, not conveying the role each instrument plays in conveying the true essence of the song. Usually it is not implemented so far as the composers don’t make their individual instrumental tracks publicly accessible. Also, separating instrumental tracks from a composed music piece is a state-of-art ML problem and attempting to animate them manually is a tedious task. This is where we come to action and automate this entire process.<br><br>
Added to all this fun, what if this whole setup went to the next dimension? A VR based implementation of such an audio visualiser would make it no less than a musical concert. A lot of VR videos have been made where objects move around the space randomly or in a very precise manner. But a virtual space where you see stuff animating on the instruments of your music would make you feel like the song has come to life.<br><br>
